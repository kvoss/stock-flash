asset pricing model

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-index_model

     r_{it} - r_f = \alpha_i + \beta_i(r_{mt} - r_f) + \epsilon_{it} \,
     \epsilon _{it}\sim N(0,\sigma _{i})\,} \epsilon_{it} \sim N(0,\sigma_i) \,

where:

    rit is return to stock i in period t
    rf is the risk free rate (i.e. the interest rate on treasury bills)
    rmt is the return to the market portfolio in period t
    α i {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}} \alpha _{i} is the stock's alpha, or abnormal return
    β i {\displaystyle \beta _{i}} \beta _{i} is the stocks's beta, or responsiveness to the market return
    Note that r i t − r f {\displaystyle r_{it}-r_{f}} r_{it} - r_f is called the excess return on the stock, r m t − r f {\displaystyle r_{mt}-r_{f}} r_{mt} - r_f the excess return on the market
    ϵ i t {\displaystyle \epsilon _{it}} \epsilon _{{it}} are the residual (random) returns, which are assumed independent normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation σ i {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}} \sigma _{i}


stock return is influenced by the market (beta), has a firm specific expected value (alpha) and firm-specific unexpected component (residual)

Each stock's performance is in relation to the performance of a market index 

Applications:
* computing stock betas
* evaluating stock selection skills
* conducting event studies. 



rate of return on a market index


single-index model assumes that there is only 1 macroeconomic factor that causes the systematic risk affecting all stock returns

Return of any stock can be decomposed into:
1. the expected excess return of the individual stock due to firm-specific factors, commonly denoted by its alpha coefficient (α),
2. the return due to macroeconomic events that affect the market, and 
3. the unexpected microeconomic events that affect only the firm.
